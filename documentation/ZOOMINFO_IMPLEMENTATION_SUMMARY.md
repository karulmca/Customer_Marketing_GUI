run_zoominfo_revenue_scraper.bat test_zoominfo_companies.xlsx
```

## Expected Success Rates

Based on typical web scraping scenarios:
- **ZoomInfo Coverage**: 30-60% of companies have profiles
- **Revenue Data**: 40-70% of profiles contain revenue
- **Overall Success**: 20-40% companies will have revenue found

## Integration with Your Existing System

The new scrapers work seamlessly with your existing LinkedIn scrapers:

1. **LinkedIn Scraper** → Company size, industry ✅ (already working)
2. **ZoomInfo Scraper** → Revenue data ✅ (newly added)
3. **Complete Scraper** → Everything together ✅ (recommended)

## Next Steps

1. **Test with your data**: Use the complete scraper on a small subset of your companies
2. **Monitor success rates**: Check the logs and adjust wait times if needed
3. **Scale up**: Process larger batches once you're satisfied with results

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Low success rates**: Increase wait times with `--wait-min 10 --wait-max 20`
- **Getting blocked**: Use VPN or try during off-peak hours
- **No revenue found**: Some companies may not have public revenue data
- **Check logs**: All scrapers create detailed log files for debugging
